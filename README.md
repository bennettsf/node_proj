# Steps to run the server
1. On your command line, move to the directory where you downloaded this project.
   
2. Type the command `npm install` while in that same directory to install the dependencies needed to run the project.
   
3. Use the command `npm index.js` or `npm express0.js` depending on which type of server you want to run (Node or Express).
   
4. Open a browser and type in the address `localhost:3000` which will print "Hello World" or the home.html file depending on which type of server you run.
   
5. From here you can navigate to `localhost:3000/about` to see the contents and validate the server is running local properly.
    
6. You can type in any other extension to test a 404 error, noting that the webpage doesn't exist.
